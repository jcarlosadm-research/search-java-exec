# **search-java-exec**
--------------------

This project search executables java files in java projects. To work, this application get a json file with an array of urls, like this:

```json
["https://github.com/aaaaa/bbbbb.git", "https://github.com/fffff/dddddd.git"]
```

The results will be a collection of folders, each them a project. For each project folder, there should exists one folder per java file thats compile without errors. Beyond that, each file must have at least a non-empty class with at least a non-empty method.

## Requirements

This project needs a java compiler installed, with a **javac** tool. Make sure to have this on system path.

This works with Python 3. Therefore, install more recent **python 3.x** interpreter. And make sure to have **pip** tool available (in windows, this comes with more recent interpreter; in linux, install **python-pip**). In linux, **python-dev** is recomended.
w
With **pip** tool, install (in ubuntu, use "sudo" before each command):
```terminal
pip install virtualenv --upgrade
pip install freeze --upgrade
```

## First time use

Create virtual environment folder by running the following command in the root project:

**Linux**:
```terminal
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
```
**Windows**:
```terminal
virtualenv -p python .venv
```

This will create a *.venv* folder in the root project. This folder contains python3 interpreter (with *python* name), libraries and tools. This allow to keep libraries in the specific versions, dispite the libraries of the system. To activate this virtual environment, run:

**Linux**:
```terminal
source .venv/bin/activate
```
**Windows**:
```terminal
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now, install the project libraries:

```terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Activate the virtual environment

If the virtual environment is not yet active, run:

**Linux**:
```terminal
source .venv/bin/activate
```
**Windows**:
```terminal
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Use

Configure the **config.py** file:

- RESULT_FOLDER: folder which will receive all results
- TEMP_REPOS_FOLDER: folder which will receive each project on *clone* phase
- INPUT_JSON_FILE: json file with urls of the projects
- PROCESSED_JSON_FILE: path and name of the json file of the processed urls
- MAX_WORKERS: number of threads

With the virtual environment activated, run:

```terminal
python main.py
```

## Tests

Run:

```terminal
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Install new libraries in the virtual environment

First, activate the virtual environment. After that, install the python library with pip:

```terminal
pip install <package>
```

And update the *requirements.txt*:

```terminal
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Deactivate the virtual environment

Run:
```terminal
deactivate
```

## second_filter.py

This filter remove some files with invalid imports and with useless methods (methods without minimal statements). To work, you need to have one folder "results" (with results of previous algorithms) and other folder "output" (to receive valid files).
